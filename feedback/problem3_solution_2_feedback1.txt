**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution accurately implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It correctly handles the input format, initializes the Union-Find data structure, and iterates through the edges to select those that do not form cycles, thus ensuring the construction of the MST. However, it does not sort the edges by weight before processing, which is a critical step in Kruskal's algorithm. This oversight could lead to incorrect results if the edges are not already sorted in the input.

**Code Style:**
The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are clear, and the use of functions for `get_parent`, `union_parent`, and `same_parent` improves readability. However, the function name `calculate` does not accurately reflect its purpose. It would be better named as something like `find_mst_weight`. Additionally, comments could be added to explain the purpose of each section of the code and the logic behind the Union-Find operations.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. All parts of the code contribute to the implementation of Kruskal's algorithm and the calculation of the MST's weight.

**Code Efficiency:**
The code's efficiency is compromised by the lack of sorting the edges by weight before processing. This step is essential in Kruskal's algorithm to ensure that the minimum weight edges are considered first. Without sorting, the algorithm may not always find the MST. Implementing a sorting step before iterating through the edges would significantly improve the code's efficiency and correctness.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The code does not handle the case where the input graph may not be connected. In such cases, the algorithm should either report an error or handle the disconnected components separately. Additionally, the code assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any invalid edges (e.g., edges with negative weights that could lead to incorrect results). Adding checks for these cases would make the code more robust.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution is a good start but needs improvements in sorting the edges and handling potential edge cases. With these adjustments, the code would accurately and efficiently find the Minimum Spanning Tree's weight for any given graph. Renaming the main function and adding comments would also enhance readability. Overall, the solution demonstrates a good understanding of Kruskal's algorithm but requires refinement to ensure correctness and robustness.
