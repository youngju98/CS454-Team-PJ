**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution attempts to find Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph but does not accurately implement the Tarjan's algorithm or Kosaraju's algorithm, which are standard methods for this problem. The solution incorrectly handles the identification of SCCs by not properly managing the stack and the low-link values. It also does not correctly implement the second DFS traversal required by Kosaraju's algorithm or the single DFS with proper low-link value updates in Tarjan's algorithm. The code does not handle all exceptions and errors, such as potential stack overflows for very large graphs, despite setting a higher recursion limit.

**Code Style:**
The code style is mostly consistent with standard Python conventions. However, variable naming could be improved for clarity (e.g., `d` could be `discovery_time`, `scc_lst` could be `scc_list`). The use of `nonlocal` for the `id` variable is acceptable but could be avoided with a different design. Comments are lacking, which makes understanding the code's intent more difficult.

**Unnecessary Code:**
The loop `for node in visited:` inside the `dfs` function does not serve any purpose and can be removed. The `parent` variable's initial assignment to `d[cur]` is unnecessary since it will be updated in the following loop. The `visited` set is not necessary because the `d` list already tracks visited nodes (those with `d[i] != -1`).

**Code Efficiency:**
The code is not efficient for finding SCCs. It incorrectly implements the algorithm, leading to incorrect results and potential inefficiencies. A correct implementation of Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm would improve efficiency. The current implementation has a time complexity that could be higher than necessary due to the incorrect handling of the stack and low-link values.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The code does not consider the case where the input graph might be disconnected. It assumes that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex, which might not always be true. Additionally, it does not handle the case where there are no SCCs in the graph, which, although not possible given the constraints, should be considered for robustness.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution does not accurately solve the problem of finding Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph. It incorrectly implements the algorithm, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies. Improvements are needed in algorithm implementation, code clarity, and handling of edge cases. A correct implementation of Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm, along with proper error handling and code optimization, is necessary to solve the problem accurately and efficiently.
