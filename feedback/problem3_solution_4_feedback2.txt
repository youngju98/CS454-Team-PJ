**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution accurately implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It correctly sorts the edges by weight, uses a union-find data structure to avoid cycles, and sums the weights of the selected edges. However, the function name `calculate` does not accurately reflect its purpose, which is to find the MST. Additionally, the code does not handle potential errors in input parsing.

**Code Style:**
The code follows standard Python conventions for variable naming, spacing, and bracket handling. However, it lacks comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code, which could improve readability. The use of lambda functions and list comprehensions is appropriate and concise.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. All lines contribute to the calculation of the MST.

**Code Efficiency:**
The solution uses Kruskal's algorithm, which is efficient for finding the MST with a time complexity of O(E log E) or O(E log V) in the worst case. The use of a union-find data structure with path compression could further optimize the code. However, the current implementation is already quite efficient.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The code does not explicitly handle the case where the input graph is not connected, although the problem statement guarantees connectivity. It also assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors. Adding input validation could make the code more robust.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution is generally correct and efficient. However, it could benefit from more descriptive function names, additional comments for clarity, and input validation to handle potential errors. The code coverage data indicates that some lines are not covered, suggesting that additional test cases could help ensure the code's reliability. Overall, the solution demonstrates a good understanding of Kruskal's algorithm and its application to finding the MST.
