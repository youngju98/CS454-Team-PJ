**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution accurately implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It correctly sorts the edges by weight, uses a Union-Find data structure to avoid cycles, and sums the weights of the selected edges to find the total weight of the MST. However, the function name `calculate` does not accurately reflect its purpose, and the input processing assumes a specific string format without validation. The solution also lacks error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases like disconnected graphs.

**Code Style:**
The code adheres to standard Python conventions for naming, spacing, and commenting. However, it could benefit from more descriptive variable names (e.g., `edges` could be `edge_list`, `parent` could be `union_find_parents`). The use of nested functions for `get_parent`, `union_parent`, and `same_parent` is clear but could be documented with comments explaining their purpose and the Union-Find algorithm's logic.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. All functions and variables are used in the calculation of the MST.

**Code Efficiency:**
The solution efficiently implements Kruskal's algorithm with a time complexity of O(E log E) due to the sorting of edges, where E is the number of edges. The Union-Find operations have an average time complexity of O(log V) with path compression, where V is the number of vertices. This is optimal for Kruskal's algorithm. However, for very large graphs, more efficient algorithms like Prim's algorithm with a Fibonacci heap could be considered.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The solution does not handle the case where the input graph is disconnected, which would result in an incorrect MST. It also assumes that the input string is always correctly formatted and does not contain any errors, which could lead to exceptions or incorrect results. Adding input validation and handling for these cases would improve the solution's robustness.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution is a clear and efficient implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph. However, it could be improved with more descriptive variable names, input validation, and error handling for edge cases like disconnected graphs. Renaming the function to something more descriptive (e.g., `find_mst`) would also enhance clarity. With these improvements, the solution would be more robust and user-friendly.
