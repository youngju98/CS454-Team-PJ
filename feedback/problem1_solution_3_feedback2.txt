**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution attempts to implement Tarjan's algorithm for finding Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph. However, there are several issues with the implementation. The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the low-link values, which are crucial for identifying SCCs. The function also incorrectly extracts nodes from the stack to form an SCC. Furthermore, the solution does not sort the vertices in each SCC in ascending order as required by the problem statement. The output format also does not match the specified requirements, as SCCs are not ordered by the smallest vertex number in each component.

**Code Style:**
The code style is generally acceptable, with proper indentation and use of whitespace. However, variable naming could be improved for clarity. For example, `d` could be renamed to `discovery_time` and `on_stack` could be renamed to `is_on_stack`. Additionally, comments are sparse and could be added to explain the logic behind the code, especially in complex parts like the `dfs` function.

**Unnecessary Code:**
The line `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)` is unnecessary and could be removed, as it is not directly related to the problem solution. The `calculate` function name is misleading, as it does not perform any calculation but rather parses input and finds SCCs. It could be renamed to something more descriptive.

**Code Efficiency:**
The solution has a time complexity of O(V + E) due to the use of Tarjan's algorithm, which is efficient for finding SCCs. However, the implementation could be optimized by reducing the number of stack operations and improving the handling of low-link values.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The solution does not handle the case where the input graph is empty (i.e., V = 0). It also does not validate the input format, which could lead to errors if the input is malformed. Additionally, the solution assumes that the graph is connected, but it does not handle the case where the graph is not connected.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution has several issues that need to be addressed. The implementation of Tarjan's algorithm is incorrect, and the solution does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement. The code style is acceptable, but variable naming and commenting could be improved. The solution has unnecessary code and could be optimized for better efficiency. Additionally, it does not handle several edge cases that could lead to errors. Overall, the solution needs significant revisions to correctly solve the problem.
