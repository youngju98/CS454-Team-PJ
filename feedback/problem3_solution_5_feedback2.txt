**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution accurately implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It correctly sorts the edges by weight, uses a disjoint set to avoid cycles, and sums the weights of the selected edges. However, the solution does not handle potential errors in input formatting or edge cases such as negative weights, which are allowed according to the problem statement. Additionally, the use of 0-based indexing for vertices might cause issues since the problem states vertices are numbered from 1 to V.

**Code Style:**
The code style is generally clear and follows standard Python conventions. However, the naming of variables and functions could be more descriptive. For example, `e` could be renamed to `edges`, and `p` could be renamed to `parent`. The use of nested functions (`get_p`, `union_p`, `same_p`) is acceptable but could be improved by adding docstrings or comments to explain their purpose.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. All lines contribute to the implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.

**Code Efficiency:**
The solution has a time complexity of O(E log E) due to the sorting of edges, which is efficient for this problem. However, the use of recursive functions (`get_p`) might lead to stack overflow for very large inputs. An iterative approach for path compression in the disjoint set could improve efficiency.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The solution does not explicitly handle negative weights, which are allowed according to the problem statement. Although the current implementation will work with negative weights because it sorts edges based on their absolute order, it might be clearer to include a comment or assertion to ensure this is intentional. Additionally, the solution assumes that the input graph is connected, which is guaranteed by the problem statement but could be a point of failure if the code is reused in a different context.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution is a good implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree. However, it could be improved by adding more descriptive variable names, handling potential input errors, and including comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of nested functions. Additionally, ensuring the solution explicitly handles negative weights and considering an iterative approach for path compression could enhance robustness and efficiency. The low code coverage percentage (43.75%) indicates that more comprehensive testing is needed to ensure all paths of the code are executed and validated.
