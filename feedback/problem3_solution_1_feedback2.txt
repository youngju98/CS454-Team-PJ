**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution accurately implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It correctly sorts the edges by weight, uses a Union-Find data structure to avoid cycles, and sums the weights of the selected edges. However, the code does not handle potential errors in input formatting or edge weight overflows. Additionally, the solution does not validate if the input graph is connected, which is a prerequisite for finding an MST.

**Code Style:**
The code adheres to standard Python conventions for naming, spacing, and commenting. However, it lacks detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the logic behind the algorithm. Adding more comments would improve readability and maintainability.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. All functions and variables are used in the calculation of the MST.

**Code Efficiency:**
The solution uses Kruskal's algorithm, which is efficient for finding MSTs in sparse graphs. The use of a Union-Find data structure with path compression optimizes the cycle detection process. However, for dense graphs, Prim's algorithm might be more efficient. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(E log E) due to the sorting of edges, which is acceptable for the given constraints.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The solution does not consider the case where the input graph might not be connected, which would result in an incorrect MST. It also does not handle negative-weight edges explicitly, although the algorithm inherently supports them. Additionally, it does not validate the input format or handle potential errors in edge specifications.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution is generally correct and efficient for finding the MST of a given graph using Kruskal's algorithm. However, it needs improvements in input validation, error handling, and commenting to enhance robustness and readability. Additionally, considering the connectivity of the input graph and explicitly handling negative-weight edges would make the solution more comprehensive.
