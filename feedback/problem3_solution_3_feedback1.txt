**Code Implementation Accuracy:**
The submitted solution does not accurately implement Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The critical error lies in the premature union of vertices without checking if they belong to the same set, which can lead to cycles in the MST. The correct implementation should only union vertices if they are not in the same set. The solution also lacks a check to ensure that the number of edges added to the MST does not exceed V-1, where V is the number of vertices.

**Code Style:**
The code style is generally clear and follows standard conventions. However, the function `calculate` does not belong to a class as suggested by the skeleton code, and the naming could be more descriptive. For example, `get_parent` could be `find_root`, and `union_parent` could be `union_sets`.

**Unnecessary Code:**
There is no unnecessary code in the submitted solution. However, the `same_parent` function is defined but not used. It could be removed to simplify the code.

**Code Efficiency:**
The code efficiency is compromised due to the incorrect implementation of Kruskal's algorithm. The premature union of vertices can lead to incorrect results and unnecessary computations. A correct implementation would improve efficiency by only considering edges that do not form cycles.

**Unconsidered Cases:**
The solution does not consider the case where adding an edge to the MST would form a cycle. It also does not handle the constraint that the total weight of the MST should be within a specific range, though this might not be necessary given the problem constraints.

**Overall Feedback:**
The submitted solution has a critical flaw in the implementation of Kruskal's algorithm, leading to incorrect results. It lacks checks for cycle formation and does not adhere to the constraints of the MST problem. Correcting these issues and improving code naming conventions would significantly enhance the solution's accuracy and readability. A correct implementation should follow the steps outlined in references like [2] and [4], ensuring that edges are added to the MST only if they do not form cycles and that the process stops once V-1 edges are added.
