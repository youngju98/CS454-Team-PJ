### Code Implementation Accuracy
The submitted solution accurately implements Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph. It correctly handles the input format, constructs the graph, and applies the algorithm to identify SCCs. However, the solution does not fully adhere to the problem's constraints, such as using a string input instead of the specified integer inputs for vertices and edges. Additionally, the use of `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)` might not be necessary and could potentially lead to issues if the graph size exceeds this limit.

### Code Style
The code style is generally clear, but there are some improvements that can be made. Variable naming could be more descriptive (e.g., `G` could be `graph`, `V` could be `num_vertices`, etc.). The use of magic numbers (like `10**6`) should be avoided and replaced with named constants. The code could benefit from additional comments to explain the logic behind Tarjan's algorithm and how it is implemented.

### Unnecessary Code
The line `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)` might be unnecessary and could be removed unless there is a specific reason to include it. The `calculate` function seems to be a leftover from a different problem and does not match the problem description provided. The solution should be encapsulated in a class or function that directly addresses the problem of finding SCCs.

### Code Efficiency
The solution uses Tarjan's algorithm, which is efficient for finding SCCs with a time complexity of O(V+E). However, the implementation could be optimized by using a more efficient data structure for the graph (e.g., an adjacency list with a more efficient way to check visited nodes). The sorting of SCCs could also be integrated into the algorithm instead of being a separate step.

### Unconsidered Cases
The solution does not explicitly handle the case where the input graph is empty or contains isolated vertices (vertices with no edges). While Tarjan's algorithm inherently handles these cases, explicit checks or comments to acknowledge these scenarios would improve the code's robustness and clarity.

### Overall Feedback
The solution provides a good implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for finding SCCs but needs improvements in code style, efficiency, and adherence to the problem's constraints. Removing unnecessary code, adding descriptive comments, and optimizing data structures will enhance the solution's quality and readability. Additionally, ensuring that all edge cases are considered or explicitly handled will make the code more robust.
